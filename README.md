## Dotfiles Design

Claude Code configurations and personalization setups that can be shared and reused across teams and projects. These dotfiles collections contain custom settings, personas, commands, and environment configurations that optimize Claude Code for specific workflows, programming languages, or organizational needs. They represent different philosophical approaches to organizing and maintaining Claude Code customizations, from minimal setups to comprehensive frameworks.

- [Memorysaver dotfiles](https://github.com/memorysaver/dotfiles) - Comprehensive Claude Code configuration with SuperClaude framework integration and advanced personas.
- [Frad's .claude](https://github.com/FradSer/dotclaude) - Minimalist Claude Code configuration focused on clean, essential customizations.

## Slash Commands

Custom command frameworks and systems that extend Claude Code's built-in slash command functionality. These tools enable developers to create specialized commands tailored to their projects, teams, or domains, facilitating workflow automation and domain-specific interactions that go far beyond the standard Claude Code command set. Perfect for teams looking to standardize complex development workflows or integrate with existing toolchains.

- [SuperClaude Framework](https://github.com/SuperClaude-Org/SuperClaude_Framework) - Comprehensive command framework with intelligent routing, personas, and MCP server integration.
- [Claude Requirements Gathering System](https://github.com/rizethereum/claude-code-requirements-builder) - Specialized system for gathering and structuring project requirements through interactive dialogue.


## Subagents

Specialized AI agents designed to work alongside Claude Code for complex, multi-faceted tasks. These subagents can be spawned for parallel processing, domain expertise, or handling specific aspects of larger projects, enabling more efficient and specialized problem-solving. They excel at breaking down complex operations into manageable, concurrent tasks while maintaining context and coordination with the main Claude Code instance.

- [Contains Studio Agents](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents) - Collection of specialized AI agents for various development tasks and domain expertise.

## Hooks

Automation systems and event-driven scripts that extend Claude Code's capabilities through programmable responses to development events. Hooks enable custom workflows, validation processes, and automated actions that can enforce coding standards, trigger deployments, run tests, or integrate with external systems. They're essential for teams wanting to embed Claude Code into existing CI/CD pipelines and development processes.

- [Claude Code Rules2Hook](https://github.com/zxdxjtu/claudecode-rule2hook) - Tool for converting coding rules and standards into automated Claude Code hooks.

## MCP Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that extend Claude Code with external capabilities, data sources, and specialized functionality. These servers enable Claude Code to integrate with external systems, access real-time information, and leverage specialized tools that enhance its problem-solving capabilities across different domains.

- [Context7 MCP Server](https://github.com/upstash/context7) - Provides up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples for programming libraries, eliminating outdated API references and hallucinated code.
- [Sequential Thinking MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking) - Sophisticated problem-solving tool that breaks down complex challenges through structured, dynamic thinking processes with branching logic and hypothesis generation.
