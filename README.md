A curated collection of awesome [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) extensions, configurations, and community resources. Claude Code's powerful extensibility through dotfiles, custom commands, subagents, and hooks enables developers to create highly customized workflows. This list showcases the best community-contributed tools that enhance and extend Claude Code's capabilities.


## Dotfiles Design

Claude Code configurations and personalization setups that can be shared and reused across teams and projects. These dotfiles collections contain custom settings, personas, commands, and environment configurations that optimize Claude Code for specific workflows, programming languages, or organizational needs. They represent different philosophical approaches to organizing and maintaining Claude Code customizations, from minimal setups to comprehensive frameworks.

## Slash Commands

Custom command frameworks and systems that extend Claude Code's built-in slash command functionality. These tools enable developers to create specialized commands tailored to their projects, teams, or domains, facilitating workflow automation and domain-specific interactions that go far beyond the standard Claude Code command set. Perfect for teams looking to standardize complex development workflows or integrate with existing toolchains.

## Subagents

Specialized AI agents designed to work alongside Claude Code for complex, multi-faceted tasks. These subagents can be spawned for parallel processing, domain expertise, or handling specific aspects of larger projects, enabling more efficient and specialized problem-solving. They excel at breaking down complex operations into manageable, concurrent tasks while maintaining context and coordination with the main Claude Code instance.

## Hooks

Automation systems and event-driven scripts that extend Claude Code's capabilities through programmable responses to development events. Hooks enable custom workflows, validation processes, and automated actions that can enforce coding standards, trigger deployments, run tests, or integrate with external systems. They're essential for teams wanting to embed Claude Code into existing CI/CD pipelines and development processes.
